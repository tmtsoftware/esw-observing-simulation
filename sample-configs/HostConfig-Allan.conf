# This is a host configuration file which contains a list of containers to be spawned by host configuration app
#
# Note: this example file shows how multiple containers and/or standalone components can be started on a host.
# The example within would actually start two instances of the same HCD and therefore doesn't represent a real
# world situation. It is provided for informational purposes only.
